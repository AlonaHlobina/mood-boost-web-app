# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

Your Mood Boost App is now configured for GitHub Pages deployment! Here's how to deploy it:

## Automatic Deployment (Recommended)

1. **Push your changes to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Configure GitHub Pages deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Enable GitHub Pages in your repository:**
   - Go to your repository on GitHub: `https://github.com/AlonaHlobina/mood-boost-web-app`
   - Click "Settings" tab
   - Scroll down to "Pages" section
   - Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"
   - The workflow will automatically deploy your app

3. **Your app will be available at:**
   `https://alonahlobina.github.io/mood-boost-web-app/`

## Important Notes

### Repository Configuration
The Vite config is already set up for your repository `mood-boost-web-app`. The base path is configured correctly.

### Audio Features
- Audio effects will work after the first user interaction (clicking a button)
- This is due to browser autoplay policies for better user experience
- All audio failures are handled gracefully

### Build Process
The GitHub Action will:
1. Install dependencies
2. Build the app with production optimizations
3. Deploy to GitHub Pages automatically

## Local Testing
To test the production build locally:
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Troubleshooting

If deployment fails:
1. Check the Actions tab in your GitHub repository for error logs
2. Ensure your repository has Pages enabled
3. Make sure the main branch has the latest changes

Your Mood Boost App is now ready for the world! ðŸŽ‰
